    <h1>Exploring ODE Simulations to Learn Selection Bias</h1>
    
    <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        This paper aims to underscore the importance of considering region-specific aspects when correcting for selection bias. Leveraging the SEIR model for epidemic simulations, we generate compartmentalized data that reflects individual-level heterogeneity in infection and contact patterns. From this, we simulate the biased reporting process to create an observed dataset that diverges from the true distribution due to systematic underrepresentation of certain demographic groups. This is done using an indicator variable to simulate region-specific selection bias and demographic disparities. Utilizing existing models for selection bias, we show that the models do not capture selection bias with the required characterization, and provide trivial or inaccurate solutions. We call for methods such as differentiable agent-based models to incorporate the underlying principles of selection bias. We also present future directions of research including a spatio-temporal perspective which can help policy makers identify true metrics and take more informed decisions.
